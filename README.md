# CNN_Cats-Dogs
## Image Classification of Cats and Dogs Using Convolutional Neural Network

### Project Description
This project is part of the Deep Learning course from Udemy and aims to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is capable of accurately classifying cat and dog images with high accuracy.

### Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras matplotlib opencv-python
   ```

3. Download cat and dog datasets from your chosen dataset source.

### Usage
1. Ensure you have downloaded and prepared the cat and dog datasets.
2. Run the `CNN.ipynb` script to train the CNN model using the prepared datasets.
3. After training the model, you can run the `Test.ipynb` script to make predictions on cat or dog images.
